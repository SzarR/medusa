This vignette dives into the details concerning the scope and requirements to 
run the various functions within the medusa package. To a certain degree, this 
vignette could be thought of as an update to the _SIOP Membership Analytics Data 
Prep Guide_ that was previously used to keep track of the various data cleaning 
strategies required to clean the yearly membership data. Most of the functions 
developed were based from the logic and work of previous volunteers. Therefore, 
we always invite others to collaborate and share information or methods that 
would better help streamline the work we are continually doing on the data. To
begin, some background context concerning the data itself is provided below:

### Nice to Know

* In 2000 through 2001, a SIOP fiscal year ran from 05/01 through 08/31. For 
example, for the date range for being a member in the year 2000 would be from 
05/01/1999 to 8/31/2000.
* For the years 2002 - 2006, the date range would be 07/01 to 10/31. For example,
for being considered a member in 2002, the date range would be 07/01/2001 to 10/31/2002.
* For 2007 through the current year, the date range for SIOP membership is 03/01 to 06/30.
For example, the date range of 03/01/2020 to 06/30/2021 would qualify somebody for 2021
membership.
* SID is a unique identifier created within the SIOP AO when data files are
generated and pulled from SQL.

### Variables of Interest

The original dataset provided by the AO contains a lot of columns and data. Not
all these features are equally important. We have therefore decided to focus 
our initial efforts on streamlining and cleaning the critical demographic
variables that are used either for modeling or reported in the annual membership
report. This section of the vignette will outline the various variables, 
their type, and levels. 

#### `SID`

A unique identifier, of type __double__, usually with a length of six. This
variable is typically used to help identify duplicate cases, and track a member
across the various SIOP membership years.

#### `City`

FFF

## Second test.
