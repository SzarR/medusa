This vignette dives into the details concerning the functions that comprise the
medusa package. The readme file will demonstrate how to use the three main
functions to clean your data. The purpose of this vignette is to provide further
context concerning the standards we have set for each of the demographic
variables. To a certain degree, this vignette could be thought of as an update 
to the _SIOP Membership Analytics Data Prep Guide_ that was previously used to 
keep track of the various data cleaning strategies required to clean the yearly 
membership data. Most of the functions developed were based from the logic and 
work of previous volunteers. Therefore, we always invite others to collaborate 
and share information or methods that would better help streamline the work we 
are continually doing on the data. To begin, some background context concerning 
the data itself is provided below:

## Membership Year Ranges

* From 2000 - 2001, a SIOP year ran from 05/01 through 08/31. 
* From 2002 - 2006, a SIOP year ran from 07/01 through 10/31.
* From 2007 onward, a SIOP year runs from 03/01 to 06/30. (For 2021: 03/01/20 - 06/30/2021) 
* SID is a unique identifer, created by the SIOP AO and serves as a unique key.

# Data Cleaning Steps

## Global Variables

The original dataset provided by the AO contains a lot of columns and variables. 
Not all these features are equally important for the time being. We have focused 
our initial efforts on streamlining and cleaning the critical demographic
variables that are used either for modeling or provided in the annual membership
report. This section of the vignette will outline the various variables, 
their type, and levels. 

### `SID`

A unique way of identifying members in an anonymous fashion. The length of the SID
is typically six digits long. It serves as the primary method to run joins between
various datasets for further analyses.

* __Type__: Double

## Geography Cleaning Stage

There are several clusters for cleaning data. One of which, geography, focuses
on cleaning the information regarding a member's location information, mainly:
* City
* State
* Country

For state, an important stipulation is noted that this variable is only populated
for members within the United States.

### `City`

The world city of a member's residence. Smaller towns or cities may be recoded
into a larger, nearby city to help streamline analytics and aggregation. Also,
acronyms for cities such as East, West, South, could be consolidated into the main
city name. For example, East Orange would turn into Orange. Additionally, 
abbreviations such as _Ft._ or _Mt._ are turned into their full names for
consistency.

* __Function step name__: step_city
* __Input Variable Name:__ City
* __Output Variable Name:__ City
* __Format__: Open ended response
* __Type__: Character

### `State`

The U.S. state of member's residence.For classifying State, the following were 
not included as valid states:
* Guam, with the acronym GU
* Virgin Islands, with the acronym VI
* Puerto Rico as PR - IS THIS TRUE??????? TODO

As an aside, in Australia, there is a state known by the acronym of WA. For
cases that identify as their country of residence being Australia, all State
responses were recoded to NA in order to avoid any confusion with
Washington state in the USA.

* __Function step name__: step_state
* __Input Variable Name:__ STATE
* __Output Variable Name:__ State_US
* __Format__: Open ended response
* __Type__: Character

### `Country`

The country of a member's residence. There is no cleaning that goes into this 
function step because the country names are clean. The only significant change
that happens to this demographic variable is the imputation of United States
where State_US has a valid state abbreviation.

* __Function step name__: step_country
* __Input Variable Name:__ Country
* __Output Variable Name:__ Country
* __Format__: Open ended response ??????????
* __Type__: Character

## Membership Cleaning Stage

Cleaning the membership columns deals primarily with three demographic 
variables: career, membership category and whether the member is in an
academic or applied setting. 

#### `Primary_Sector`  

The `Primary_Sector` variable describes the type of field the member is 
operating in. The fields to be determined most relevant for analyses are
included in the table below, under _Levels_.

TODO: Insert more background information on why this categorization exists.
TODO: Make this a factor-level variable?

* __Function step name__: step_sector
* __Input Variable Name:__ Academic Sector (Primary), Government Sector (Primary),
Private Sector (Primary), Other Sector (Primary), Not Provided (Primary)
* __Output Variable Name:__ Primary_Sector
* __Format__: Open ended response ??????????
* __Type__: Character
* __Levels__: Academy, Government, Private, Other, Not Provided

#### `Primary_Occupation`

The `Primary_Occupation` variable is the second output from the `step_sector`
cleaning function. It provides a much more nuanced approach to reporting the
occupations of SIOP members. There exist at least thirty categorizations for
this variable, ranging from Consulting firm to Financial services. This variable,
in combination with `Primary_Sector` provides an interesting perspective on
types of roles by the various sectors. 

* __Function step name__: step_sector
* __Input Variable Name:__ Academic Sector (Primary), Government Sector (Primary),
Private Sector (Primary), Other Sector (Primary), Not Provided (Primary)
* __Output Variable Name:__ Primary_Occupation
* __Format__: Open ended response ??????????
* __Type__: Character
* __Levels__: Too many to explicitly document

#### `MemberGroup`

MemberGroup documents whether a member in the data table is an individual
member within the society, or a prospect that has not yet fully signed up.

TODO: Flesh this out more, why do we capture this and how does it work?

* __Function step name__: step_membergroup
* __Input Variable Name:__ MemberGroup
* __Output Variable Name:__ MemberGroup
* __Format__: Drop-down selection
* __Type__: Factor
* __Levels__: Individual, Prospect

#### `AcademicApplied`

The AcademicApplied variable captures whether an individual is within the 
academic sector, or the applied sector. It is a dichotomous variable.

TODO: We categorize Other Sector as Applied, is this okay?

* __Function step name__: step_academicapplied
* __Input Variable Name:__ Academic Sector (Primary), Government Sector (Primary),
Private Sector (Primary), Other Sector (Primary)
* __Output Variable Name:__ AcademicApplied
* __Format__: Open ended response ??????????
* __Type__: Factor
* __Levels__: Academic, Applied

## Education Cleaning Stage

Education cleaning deals with demographic variables such as highest
degree completed, institution attended, and the type of institution. Since
the School variable is open ended, a custom database has been built that
joins with the main analysis file to help streamline reporting of schools
and their profit or non-profit status.

#### `HighestDegree`

Highest_Degree specifies the level of education that was the highest obtained
for a specific SIOP member. This variable requires a lot of cleaning due to the
messy nature of the data. Lots of members included various acronyms, and specialized
degree titles for this field, making the standardization and reporting tedious.

* __Function step name__: step_highestdegree
* __Input Variable Name:__ Degree
* __Output Variable Name:__ Highest_Degree
* __Format__: Open ended response
* __Type__: Factor
* __Levels__: Associate, Bachelors, Doctorate, Other, ABD, Masters

#### `Priv_Publ`

Priv_Publ specifies the level of education that was the highest obtained
for a specific SIOP member. This variable requires a lot of cleaning due to the
messy nature of the data. Lots of members included various acronyms, and specialized
degree titles for this field, making the standardization and reporting tedious.

* __Function step name__: step_privatepublic
* __Input Variable Name:__ Control
* __Output Variable Name:__ Priv_Publ
* __Format__: Open ended response ???
* __Type__: Factor
* __Levels__: International, Private, Public
